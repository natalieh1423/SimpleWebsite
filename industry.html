        <h2>1. About the Industry</h2>
        <p>
            One industry of interest to me is international business. The international business industry involves global trade, investment, and operations between different countries.
             Inside this, there is a specific industry that interests me the most, which is global supply chains. 
            This particular segment interests me the most because I find it to be rather complex, dealing with economic, political, cultural, and logistical problems.        </p>

        <h2>2. A Career That Interests Me</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Career:</strong> Supply Chain and Logistical Operations
        </p>
        <p>
            I would want to be the director of supply chain and logistical operations for a multinational company. 
            I find it fascinating to look at other cultures and the way that they view life. 
            I also grew up abroad, which is why I think this interests me so much. 
            I am also a big problem solver, which is why I would enjoy solving logistical and supply chain problems. 
            Not everything in this industry is clear-cut, which is why being able to think critically is vital. 

        </p>

        <h2>3. An Ethical Issue in This Career/Industry</h2>
        <p>
           There are a lot of ethical issues that could arise from this. One example is cultural differences. 
           Communication being direct in our country might come across as rude and unwelcoming in another. 
           In many countries, giving a gift is seen as respectful, but in others it is seen as bribery. 
           These are all dilemmas where it can be hard to see the other person's culture when it is different from your own, and knowing how to control your own instincts. 
        </p>

        <h2>4. How My Personal Values Shape My Response</h2>
        <p>
         I was raised in 2 very different cultures, Asian and American. My entire family is American, and a lot of my friends were too, but I grew up in Singapore.
          Through that experience, I gained insight into how other cultures and religions view life, which helped me in my perception of things that are different from me. 
          For example, it is easier for me to be more understanding and open to new ideas because that is how I grew up. 
        </p>

        <h2>5. Cybersecurity Issues That Could Arise</h2>
        <p>
            Supply chain is a very technology-dependent industry these days, which makes it a large target for hackers to seize sensitive information.
             Everything that we have learned in this class so far concerning data privacy and data protection applies in this industry.
              On top of that, the sheer number of partners and data involved means there are even more points where things can go wrong. 
            This is even more reason that these companies need to have extensive cybersecurity measures. 
        </p>

               <h2>6. Cybersecurity Best Practices for This Industry</h2>
        <p>
           Best cybersecurity practices within this industry include robust vetting and zero-trust architecture. 
           Due to the high volume of data and the nature of the kind of data, including people's addresses and other kinds of personal data, the people designing firewalls and security measures need to assume there will be data breaches and verify everything.
