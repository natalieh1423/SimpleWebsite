        <h2>Responsibility</h2>

        <h3>What it Means:</h3>
        <p>
            Responsibility, taking accountability for your actions, is something that I take very seriously. 
            In this context, in my personal values, I am talking about moral responsibility the most, being accountable for the things that you did, because it is the right thing to do. 
        </p>
        <h3>Where it Comes From:</h3>
            <p>
                I think this value derives from academic work where there were strict deadlines and tasks that I had to accomplish. 
            </p>
         <h3>Why it is Important to Me and the Consequences of Ignoring it:</h3>
            <p>
                This is important to me because I believe it is the right thing to do. 
                Not being responsible has significant ramifications for others because, 99% of the time, my responsibilities are expectations imposed on me by others. 
                Failing to do so can cause damage to relationships.
            </p>

        <h2>Loyalty</h2>

        <h3>What it Means:</h3>
             <p>
                Loyalty is a strong feeling of commitment or allegiance to a person or a group, especially when things change. 
                I think a very strong example of this is in wedding vows, where a very common line is “for better or worse, in sickness and in health.”
             </p>

        <h3>Where it Comes From:</h3>
            <p>
                 I think this value is derived from the fact that I have always tried to be the best friend that I can, and loyalty is a big part of that. 
                 It is something that I take into every relationship that I have. 
            </p>
         <h3>Why it is Important to Me and the Consequences of Ignoring it:</h3>
            <p>
                These values are important to me because I love the relationships that I have, and the ramifications of not staying loyal lead to them leaving and causing broken relationships. 
                To me, that is the biggest consequence of not being loyal.
            </p>
      


        <h2>Self-Discipline</h2>

        <h3>What it Means:</h3>
             <p>
                Self-discipline is controlling your impulses and emotions to stay focused on long-term goals rather than what you want in the short term. 
                I am a very driven person and always am trying to be one step ahead.
                One example of that is me taking this class now. I am taking winter and summer classes to complete my undergraduate requirements early and begin my 1-year International Business master's program.
             </p>

        <h3>Where it Comes From:</h3>
            <p>
               I know this comes from growing up as a swimmer; waking up at 4 am 3 times a week since 5th grade, going all the way until the end of high school. 
               That is a lot of dedication and is something that I learned very early on.   
                
            </p>
         <h3>Why it is Important to Me and the Consequences of Ignoring it:</h3>
            <p>
                This one is more of an internal value, as not adhering to self-discipline I would feel like I have failed myself.
                This is different from my other values as a lot of those are more focused on how I would make others feel, versus this where it is focused on how I would feel. 
            </p>
            

        <h2>Adaptability</h2>

        <h3>What it Means:</h3>
             <p>
                Adaptability is being able to adjust and pivot when things do not go exactly as planned. Not everything in life is going to go the exact way you planned it. 
                There are also so many times where there might be spur-of-the-moment decisions that could end up being some of the best memories of your life.
             </p>

        <h3>Where it Comes From:</h3>
            <p>
              I believe I value this so highly because I grew up in Asia, constantly traveling to many different countries. Travel is one example where things rarely go exactly to plan.   
            </p>

         <h3>Why it is Important to Me and the Consequences of Ignoring it:</h3>
            <p>
                Being able to adapt comes in handy in many situations, such as being able to read a room or being able to go with the flow. 
                There are so many situations in my life that change instantly, and so many memories that were all spur of the moment decisions. 
                I can't imagine not being able to have done those because I was not being adaptable.  
                Being unable to do that can cause unnecessary friction between yourself and others.
